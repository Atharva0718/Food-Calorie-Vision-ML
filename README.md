#  AI-Powered Food Recognition & Calorie Estimator  

## Project Overview  
This project is an **AI-powered food recognition tool** that:  
âœ… **Identifies food items** from images using a deep learning model.  
âœ… **Estimates the calorie content** based on pre-defined nutritional values.  
This tool helps users **track their dietary intake** and make informed food choices.  

##  Tech Stack  
- **Python** (TensorFlow, OpenCV, NumPy)  
- **Deep Learning Model** (Trained on [Food-101 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/food-101))  
- **Pre-trained Model:** Custom-trained CNN model  

## Dataset  
We used the **Food-101 dataset** from Kaggle, containing **101,000 images** of **101 food categories**.

## Features  
 **Food Image Classification**: Identifies food items from images.  
 **Calorie Estimation**: Provides calorie content (kcal per 100g).  
 **User-Friendly Interface**: Works with a single image input.
